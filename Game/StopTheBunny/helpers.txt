The main goal of Team Bunny is to go to Mexico
on a vacation. You have to stop them before 
they reach the border. To do so, you have one 
main weapon - towers that throw carrots and 
lure the bunnies away from their path. Place 
the towers near the bunny road and upgrade them 
in order to lure all the different kinds of bunnies.
